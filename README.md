# AI Health Companion

An intelligent healthcare assistant app for patients to describe symptoms, get AI-driven doctor suggestions, and consult the right specialist in real-time.

AI Health Companion is a smart, conversational healthcare application designed to assist medical patients with personalized care guidance. Patients can describe their symptoms in natural language, and the AI-powered system will analyze their input to recommend the appropriate type of doctorâ€”be it a physiotherapist, neurologist, orthopedic specialist, or general practitioner.

Beyond suggestions, the app offers a seamless experience by connecting the patient with a virtual consultation flow where they can chat directly with a simulated specialist for preliminary advice or rehabilitation guidance. The system uses OpenAI's language models to emulate professional medical conversation and integrates structured knowledge about common ailments to deliver actionable, empathetic responses.

Ideal for chronic pain sufferers, post-operative patients, or individuals undergoing physiotherapy, the app can also provide tailored exercise routines for recovery. It includes a conversational history for continuity, symptom tracking, and reminders for follow-up care.

This app bridges the gap between initial symptom awareness and professional care, reducing the burden on hospitals while empowering users to take early action. It is not a replacement for medical diagnosis but serves as an intelligent guide to help users understand their condition and seek appropriate treatment promptly.
